                        <p>The following blog contains a recollection of all of the series of things that we did during the project.
                            In simple terms, an online exam system is software that automates examination-related tasks to save time and increase efficiency.
                            This includes routine online assessment activities such as designing the assessment pattern, creating test objectives,
                            managing exam administration, and streamlining the evaluation process.</p>
                        <h1>Conduct Of Pre-and-Post Examination Processes</h1>
                        <p>Investing in the best examination system is an intelligent decision for all types of educational institutions. It can aid teachers in a wide range of pre-and post-examination activities that consume a vast amount of time and energy.</p>
                        <p>Setting question papers is a breeze with automated online examination software. It supports the online education model and enables teachers to create and upload e-content for students that can be accessed by them anytime and anywhere.</p>
                        <p>This is a smart way to boost learner morale, enhance flexibility and help students prepare for examinations at their pace.</p>
                        <p>It is challenging for teachers, professors and faculty members to manage an array of examination-related processes such as completing subject syllabus, marking attendance, and setting objective exam papers.</p>
                        <p> online exam system is a business asset that has a user-friendly interface that can enhance workflows, save precious resources, and drive efficiency in administrative processes.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading"> High-Quality Student Learning Outcomes</h2>
                        <p>Technology is a game-changer in the online education industry! Virtual education serves as an alternative method to ensure an error-free, qualitative, and structured teaching-learning experience.</p>
                        <p>Educational organizations can accrue multiple benefits by shifting to online exam system as it positively impacts student learning outcomes.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">Educational ERP solutions are the most preferred tool that can promote a seamless teaching-learning experience. It is a robust software that can help educational institutions adapt to the virtual environment.</blockquote>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Question Paper Generation</h2>
                        <p>online exam system is a versatile tool that makes it easy for teachers to set multiple patterns of questionnaires without investing too much time or effort.</p>
                        <p>It eliminates several logistical tasks that include selecting questions manually, designing the test paper, printing and distributing the questionnaire</p>
                        <p>There are many pre-designed templates available that enable instructors to set multiple-choice questions (MCQ) or subjective exam papers.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="static/images/4.png" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">A demo representation of software.</span>
                        <p>The best results came by using the VGG which were right about 68â€“70% of the time, but even the linear models did a very good job. Although 50% accuracy does not seem like a lot, it is still more than if you would pick up a picture and a label at random. There, you would be right about 20% of the time.</p>
                        <p>The VGG, however, performs even better than humans do in this particular dataset. The difference between the CNNs and the MLPs was that the CNNs were extracting features that they deemed important by themselves, while we were feeding either pixels or landmarks as features to the MLPs</p>
